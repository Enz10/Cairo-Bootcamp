2.
    a) O(n): It is the one that takes the longest to solve the algorithm is linearly dependent on the input.
    
       O(1): The solution is independent of the inputs.

       O(log n): The time taken is proportional to the log of inputs.

3. The best is O(1).

4. Because strong privacy features are not supported yet by the protocol.
